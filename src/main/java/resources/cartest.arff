% 3. Past Usage:
% 
%    The hierarchical decision model, from which this dataset is
%    derived, was first presented in 
% 
%    M. Bohanec and V. Rajkovic: Knowledge acquisition and explanation for
%    multi-attribute decision making. In 8th Intl Workshop on Expert
%    Systems and their Applications, Avignon, France. pages 59-78, 1988.
% 
%    Within machine-learning, this dataset was used for the evaluation
%    of HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool), which was proved to be able to
%    completely reconstruct the original hierarchical model. This,
%    together with a comparison with C4.5, is presented in
% 
%    B. Zupan, M. Bohanec, I. Bratko, J. Demsar: Machine learning by
%    function decomposition. ICML-97, Nashville, TN. 1997 (to appear)
% 
% 4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
% 
%    Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical
%    decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX
%    (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision
%    making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates
%    cars according to the following concept structure:
% 
%    CAR                      car acceptability
%    . PRICE                  overall price
%    . . buying               buying price
%    . . maint                price of the maintenance
%    . TECH                   technical characteristics
%    . . COMFORT              comfort
%    . . . doors              number of doors
%    . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
%    . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
%    . . safety               estimated safety of the car
% 
%    Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target
%    concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts:
%    PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model
%    related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for
%    these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).
% 
%    The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural
%    information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input
%    attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.
% 
%    Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be
%    particularly useful for testing constructive induction and
%    structure discovery methods.
