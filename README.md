# Spark-Seperate-And-Conquer-Algorithm

MSc Thesis

- This repository contains code for my MSc work with regards to implementing a Separate and Conquer Algorithm in Spark 
as well as its evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall) that was used to analyze large datasets using distributed in-memory
data processing capabilities in Spark across a number of commodity machines (1, 5, 10, 15, 20) in a cluster.
